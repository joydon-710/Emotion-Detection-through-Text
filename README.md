# Emotion-Detection-through-Text

I developed a machine learning model to analyze and classify emotions from textual data, covering all key stages from data preprocessing to model evaluation. The process began with thorough text cleaning, where I removed special characters, normalized text to lowercase, and addressed missing data to prepare it for analysis. I employed TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction, converting the text into a numerical format that machine learning algorithms could use effectively. The model's core was a Naive Bayes classifier, implemented using Pythonâ€™s scikit-learn library, to accurately categorize emotions. The model's performance was rigorously evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Throughout the project, I leveraged tools like Pandas, scikit-learn, and NLTK, applying essential machine-learning techniques to achieve reliable emotion classification.
